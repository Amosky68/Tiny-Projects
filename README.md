# Tiny-Projects
some of my tiny projects are here ! 


Here is the presentation of each of my small programs, and how to use them correctly.
You will notice that I use two different graphic libraries (Arcade and Pygame), that's because each has its advantages and disadvantages. 



#Programs presentation :



##Game of life 2.py :
  this is a simulation of the Conway's game of life
  by pressing SPACE you can pause the simulation. 
  to accelerate it, you need to press the RIGHT and LEFT Arrow 
  you can Empty the grid by pressing R and add a new cell with E 
  
  
  
##Game2048.py :
  this is a remake of the 2048 mobile game !
  to play the game you need to press the ARROWS keys, this will move the tile on the right direction
  to reset the game, simply press R
  the game finishes when you reach the 2048 tile or when no movement is possible
  

##factalsPyGame.py :
  this program is a fractal drawer
  the drawn fractal is a part of the julia set (using complex numbers) 
  to change the drawn fractal you need to reload the program with an other value for C *
  
  *   The formula for drawing the fractal is ZÂ² + c | where c and z are complex numbers
      if this series converges, we draw the pixel in black
